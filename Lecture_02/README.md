<!--?* This is lecture 02  -->

<!--! The foremost thing we learn is that npm is not "Node Package Manager" it is a manager that manages packages -->

<!--? How to npm init and what are the things of it. -->

{

<!--* Installing the dependencies from npm -->
<!--? Types of dependencies => -->

<!--todo 1. Dev Dependencies -> Dependencies which are used during the development phase => (npm insatll -D dependencty-name) -->
<!--todo 2. Normal Dependencies => Dependencies which are used in the production also => (npm install dependency-name)  -->

}

<!--! parcel  -->
<!--* it is a bundler  -->

{
eg., => "parcel": "^2.15.4"

<!--? left shows the dependency name and right side shows the version number -->
<!-- *this "^" sign is called "caret", -->

<!--todo: this ^ caret shows that the version of the dependencies can be upgraded in the future when a new "minor update" is released. -->

<!-- todo: "~" tilde sign is also used but it is used for "major update" automatically update major update but it is not reccommended -->

<!--? if there is no sign before the version number then the version of dependency will never be update automatically  -->

}

{

<!--! package-lock.json  -->
<!--* it keeps a track of what dependencies are installed and especially the exact version of the dependencies which. -->
<!--* This "locks down" the versions, ensuring that npm install will always install the identical set of packages and versions  -->

}

{

<!--! node_modules -->
<!--* it contains all the code that is fetched from the npm for the dependencies we installed, like a database for the dependencies and packages that we used -->
<!--? a dependency or package can have their own set of dependencies these dependencies are called transit dependencies -->
<!--? node_modules contains all the set of dependencies which are needed by the dependencies we installed in out app -->

}

{

<!--! gitignore -->
<!--? it is a file that is used to ignore files like node_modules, .env that must not be published on github -->

    <!--todo: should we upload node_modules over github -->
    <!--* absolutely NO -->

    <!--todo: should we upload package.json and package-lock.json over github -->
    <!--* YES -->

    <!--? if we have package.json and package-lock.json we can easily regenerate node_modules -->

}

{

<!--* npx parcel index.html => this runs our app at localhost:1234 -->
<!--todo but in package.json file we have to remove main:"App.js", this will throw an error -->
<!--? npx means executing a package like here parcel -->

    here parcel build a "Development Build" for our app and host it on localhost:1234

}

{

<!--? Lecture 02 part2 -->
<!--* removing the cdn links and installing the react from npm into our machine(app) npm i react, npm i react-dom -->
<!--! Now we got errors like React is not defined as we are using React.createElement because we didnot have imported React yet in App.js -->
<!--? import React from react and ReactDOM from react-dom, this successfully imported the React and ReactDOM but this alone will create some error which says Browser scripts doesnt have export or imports -->
<!--todo:=> this can be resolve by adding a type attribute in the script tag in index.html file and give it a value module like "type=module" -->

    #parcel
    -Dev Build
    -Local Server => host app to server
    -HMR - Hot Module Replacement => automatically reloads the browser when there is a change in any file
    -File Watching Algo - it keep an eye on all the files and tracks every save, any changes over them, {written in C++}
    -Caching -> Faster Builds
    -Image Optimization
    -Minification of files
    -Bundling
    -Compressing
    -Code Splitting
    -Differential Bundling -> to support older browser
    -Diagnostic -> beautifull errors or easy readable errors
    -Error Handling
    -HTTPS
    -Tree Shaking -> remove unused code
    -Different dev and prod bundles

}

<!--! why react is very fast? -->
<!--* because react uses may other packages, libraries to make a production ready app, ex parcel -->

<!--? running the app using parcel will create a dist folder which contains minified file generated by parcel -->

<!--!  we dont need these file on github -->

{

<!--? how to make our app compatible with older browsers -->

<!--* browserslist is a thing in node_modules which takes care of this and we have to configure it in package.json file -->
 <!--todo: "browserslist": [ "last 2 Chrome version, last 3 Edge version"] this will make the app compatible with defined browser versions-->

# browserslist take an array or browser versions

# best practice is to write "last 2 versions" in the array this will make the app compatible with all the last 2 versions of all the browsers

}
